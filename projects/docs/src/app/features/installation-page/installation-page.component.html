<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>
  NGVerse is not a traditional library that you install and import; instead, it
  provides components that you can copy and paste directly into your project.
  This approach ensures flexibility and ease of use without adding unnecessary
  dependencies to your codebase. However, NGVerse components rely on the
  angular/cdk library. This dependency handles complex technical
  implementations, for example keyboard navigation for select options, so you
  donâ€™t need to build such functionality yourself.
</p>
<p>To get started:</p>

1. Install angular/cdk
<pre>npm install angular/cdk</pre>
2. Add NGVerse components to your project. There are three ways to do this:
<p>
  1. Using Angular Schematics (Recommended) NGVerse provides Angular schematics
  to make it easy to add components to your project. To use this option: Install
  the NGVerse schematics package: bash Copy code npm install ng-verse Use the
  Angular CLI to generate the desired component: bash Copy code ng generate
  ng-verse:component button This command adds the button component to your
  project, along with all its dependencies.
</p>

  2. Download a Component You can navigate to the NGVerse component page, select
  the desired component, and click the Download (.zip) button. This will
  download a ZIP file containing all the necessary files for the component,
  which you can then import into your project.
</p>
<p>
  3. Copy and Paste Code For quick integration, you can copy the source code of
  the component directly from the NGVerse page and paste it into your project.
